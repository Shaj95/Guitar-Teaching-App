# Guitar-Teaching-App
 A basic Guitar Teaching App for a 1-month University Project

# Overview

As someone that has played guitar for the most part of my life, I often taught my friends or family members upon request, and I tended to be quite good at it. I always felt that it would be extremely beneficial if I could teach multiple people ‘simultaneously’ through an app – thus requiring less physical work: the primary goal of most apps and technology. 

My app, which will be called ‘Guitarist’ (subject to change) is for those who wish to learn to play the guitar as complete beginners, and only wish to play it purely as a hobby and not necessarily at a professional level. This means that it will not go into detail about musical theory (which not everyone wants to learn) and instead only focus on the essentials. However, given that it teaches beginner, intermediate and advanced techniques; it is also beneficial for those that already play but wish to further hone their skills.

This way the user gets up to speed with playing the guitar with exceptional clarity and have mastered all chords and certain songs that I have selected that serve as a benchmark for your current progress.

The reason I chose this project is that playing the guitar is my hobby and I found it to be an exciting prospect to create an app related to it; one that is not too complicates as I am new to the Software Development/Mobile Development field. 

Furthermore, there are hundreds of thousands of people across the world that have had a fleeting thought of wanting to learn the guitar but do not have access to a good teacher that is convenient and not costly either. At the end of the day this app gives me a potential revenue stream as well.

NOTE: Upon downloading the project folder, refer to the pdf file for full development documentation

# How To Run

Download the project on to your computer. Open the folder in Android Studio.

Ensure that all files have been downloaded and are present in the project folder when you have opened the project in Android Studio.
It may take a couple of minutes for all files to pre-load into Android Studio and for Gradle to build them.

On the right-hand side panel, you will find 'Device Manager', that allows you to choose an Android Device as your virtual simulator. Choose any of your choice (I choose Pixel 5 which has a 6-inch screen).

Click the play button that begins simulating the project and it will be dislayed on the virtual device. This same panel contains the 'back' and 'home' buttons as well that allows you to navigate to the previous page.

Upon running, there should not be any errors that indicate any file is missing.

# Code Complexity

I intend to keep the complexity low but effective, and yet demonstrate some prowess. Possibly use some unique code implementations/tools.

Can possibly use a system to measure time, memory and energy usage (later).

This is currently a very basic project that does not utilize data structures because it was my first android project that was developed in an incremental manner on a weekly basis within 6 weeks during my intense Master's Program, and before i learned data structures. Therefore, in future I can improve upon its aesthetics, speef of use, more navigation options and overall quality

# Code Maintainability, Readability and Reusability

Code should be loosely coupled. Should be able to demonstrate the addition of code/variables, reuse older code (such as reader),
The code should be well segmented, naming conventions. Minimize smells.

However, the code quality is not ideal as this was produced in my second semester - before i learned about code smells, refactoring or Design Patterns. A better demonstration of this is the Race Strategy Simulator Application I made in Java (in my repositories). 
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, this was developed as weekly deliverables in 6 weeks along side other Master's level courses that had their own respective project deliverables.

In future, I plan to refactor a lot of the code in this Kotlin Android project as well as apply data structure usage as well as embedded youtube videos instead of locally stored videos.
